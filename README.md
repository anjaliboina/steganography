# steganography
LSB steganography is a technique that conceals information by modifying the least significant bits of an image's pixel data.  Encode: Hide text messages inside images. Decode: Extract hidden messages from encoded images. The tool is implemented using Python's tkinter for the GUI and the Pillow (PIL) library for image processing.
